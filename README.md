A tensorflow implementation of convolutional auto-encoder with skip connetions

This is a simple tensorflow implementation of convolutional auto encoders with symmetric skip conncetions.
The architecture can be seen in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08921.pdf
The intent of this paper is to have a very powerful decoder with information flowing from encoder with the help of symmetric skip connections.
